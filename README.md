# nukeScriptCollector

The Nuke Script Collector is a simple Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) tool that searches for `.nk` files (Nuke scripts) in a specified source directory and its subdirectories, collects them, and compresses them into a single `.zip` file in a destination directory chosen by the user.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and straightforward GUI to select directories.
- **Recursive Search**: Scans the specified source directory and all of its subdirectories for `.nk` files.
- **Zip Compression**: Collects all `.nk` files and compresses them into a `.zip` archive.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any platform that supports Python and tkinter, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
